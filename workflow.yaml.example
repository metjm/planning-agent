# Workflow phase configuration
workflow:
  # Planning phase - which agent creates the initial plan
  planning:
    agent: claude
    max_turns: 50

  # Reviewing phase - can use multiple agents for parallel review
  reviewing:
    agents:
      - claude
      - codex
    # Aggregation mode determines when revision is needed:
    # - any_rejects: If ANY reviewer rejects, needs revision (default, strictest)
    # - all_reject: Only if ALL reviewers reject
    # - majority: If majority rejects
    aggregation: any_rejects

  # Revising phase - which agent revises the plan based on feedback
  revising:
    agent: claude

# Failure handling policy (optional - defaults shown)
# Controls how transient failures and recovery are handled
failure_policy:
  max_retries: 2           # Maximum retry attempts for transient failures
  backoff_secs: 5          # Backoff multiplier in seconds between retries
  # Action when all reviewers fail after retries:
  # - abort: Stop workflow with error (default)
  # - save_state: Save state for later recovery in TUI mode
  # - continue_without_review: Proceed to revision phase without reviews
  on_all_reviewers_failed: abort
